1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
    usertrap()

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
    7

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
    Machine mode

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the varialable num?
    lw      s2,0(zero) # 0x0

5. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
    Deference 0x0 while 0x0 is not mapped.

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
    name: "initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"; process id: 1
